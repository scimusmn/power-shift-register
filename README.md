Power Shift Registers
=====================

Modular power shift register boards, based on the [TPIC6A595NE] chips.

These boards come in two varieties: *mother boards*, which include a Metro Mini and lack a data in port, and *daughter boards*, which are intended to have data shifted in to them. These two designs exist so that for applications that require only shift registers no additional hardware is necessary, but custom boards can still be designed to control the daughter boards.
